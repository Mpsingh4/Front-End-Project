      <Features title="What is GPT-3" text="GPT-3 (Generative Pretrained Transformer 3) is a language model developed by OpenAI. It's an advanced AI model designed to generate human-like text based on the input it receives. GPT-3 uses deep learning and a transformer architecture to understand and generate text, making it capable of performing a wide range of language tasks like writing, summarizing, translating, and even answering questions with context." />

      <Features title="Chatbots" text="The GPT-3 chatbot is an AI-based conversational system powered by OpenAI's GPT-3 language model. It is designed to understand and generate human-like text responses based on the user's input." />
      <Features title="Knowledgebase" text="The knowledge base of GPT-3 is a vast collection of text data that the model was trained on. This data includes books, articles, websites, and other publicly available written content. The knowledge base allows GPT-3 to understand a wide range of topics, including science, history, technology, culture, and more. However, it's important to note that the model doesn't 'know' things in the way humans doâ€”rather, it has learned patterns and associations from the data it was trained on." />
      <Features title="Education" text="GPT-3 can be used in education for personalized tutoring, writing assistance, and language learning, offering explanations and practice across various subjects. It helps with research, problem-solving, and providing interactive lessons for students, making learning more engaging." />
